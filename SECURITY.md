# Security Recommendations

This document provides security recommendations for both backend and frontend components of the application.

## Frontend Security

### Current Implementations
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Input validation in forms
- Content sanitization using DOMPurify
- Security headers in HTML (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Typed WebSocket messages for safer data handling

### Recommended Future Improvements
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper user authentication
   - Add role-based access control
   - Use JWT with proper expiration and refresh token rotation

2. **Input Validation & Output Sanitization**
   - Ensure all user inputs are validated both client and server side
   - Sanitize all data received from APIs before rendering

3. **Secure API Communication**
   - Implement proper CSRF protection
   - Use HTTPS for all communication
   - Consider adding API rate limiting on the client side

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Consider using `npm audit` or similar tools to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions for consistent builds

5. **Browser Storage Security**
   - Avoid storing sensitive data in localStorage
   - Use HttpOnly cookies for authentication tokens
   - Implement secure session handling

## Backend Security

### Current Implementations
- Input validation via Pydantic schemas
- CORS protection based on environment
- Rate limiting middleware
- Security headers middleware
- Global error handler to prevent information leakage
- API endpoint protection

### Recommended Future Improvements
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement OAuth2 with Password flow or similar
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing
   - Implement proper JWT validation

2. **Database Security**
   - Use parameterized queries (already in place with SQLAlchemy)
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Consider adding row-level security for multi-tenant data

3. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Implement secure logging (no sensitive data in logs)
   - Add audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Set up monitoring for unusual patterns

4. **API Security**
   - Further restrict CORS in production
   - Implement more granular rate limiting
   - Add request throttling for authentication endpoints

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
   - Implement secrets management
   - Document required environment variables
